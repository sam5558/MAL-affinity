Also special thanks for https://github.com/purplepinapples/mal-affinity


# How to use it 
This script works with Python3.6+.

Before running the script, install these packages :
`pip3 install collections`
`pip3 install jikanpy`
`pip3 install aniffinity`
`pip3 install tabulate`
`pip3 install json`

Also, edit the script with your favourite editor, then change this : 
username = "Guts__"
to your username :
username = "myusername"

P.S : This script takes time to get calculate your users affinity, so the more you have friends on MyAnimeList the more you'll have to wait until the script gives you the affinity values.

# Thanks
